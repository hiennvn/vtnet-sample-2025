### **US3.1: Document Content Indexing**

- **Priority:** High
- **Size:** 8
- **Description:** As a System, I need to automatically process and index the content of uploaded documents so that they can be used by the chatbot for answering questions.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - When a document is uploaded, a background process is triggered.
    - The process extracts all text content from the document (for supported formats like PDF, DOCX, TXT).
    - The extracted text and its metadata (e.g., source document ID, project ID) are stored in a searchable index.
    - The process handles failures gracefully and logs any documents that could not be indexed.
    - This user story is foundational for the chatbot to function.

### **US3.3: Ask Questions within a Single Project**

- **Priority:** High
- **Size:** 8
- **Description:** As any user, I want to ask a question in natural language about the documents within the current project so that I can get quick answers without reading through all the material.

    - When I type a question (e.g., "What is the budget for this project?") and submit it,
    - The chatbot uses the indexed content *from that project only* to generate a concise answer.
    - The answer is displayed in the chat interface.
    - The response should be reasonably fast (e.g., within a few seconds).

    - Below the answer, there is a "Sources" or "References" section.

### **US3.5: Ask Questions Across All Projects**

    - The chatbot interface indicates that it will search across all accessible projects.
    - When I ask a question (e.g., "Which projects are using the 'Agile' methodology?"), the chatbot synthesizes information from all relevant documents across all projects.
    - The sources cited in the answer should also indicate which project they belong to.
