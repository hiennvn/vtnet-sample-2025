# Product Overview: Project Document Management System

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the Project Document Management System. The system aims to be a centralized platform for storing, managing, and retrieving project-related documents efficiently. It is designed to enhance collaboration, ensure information accessibility, and streamline project workflows for all stakeholders involved.

## 2. Objectives

The primary objectives of this system are:

- **Centralized Document Repository:** To establish a single source of truth for all project documents, eliminating scattered information and version control issues.
- **Streamlined Workflow:** To simplify the process of uploading, organizing, and accessing project documentation for project managers and team members.
- **Enhanced Accessibility:** To provide stakeholders, especially senior management, with easy and quick access to any project's documentation.
- **Intelligent Information Retrieval:** To enable users to not only access documents but also retrieve specific information from within them using an intelligent chatbot.
- **Improved Project Oversight:** To offer a clear view of project progress and details through well-organized documentation.
- **Security and Control:** To ensure that project documents are secure and that access is managed through a role-based permission system.

## 3. User Personas

The system will cater to the following user roles:

| Role              | Description                                                                                                                              |

    - Enforces role-based access control (RBAC) to secure projects and documents.

- **Project Management Module:**
    - Manages the lifecycle of projects (CRUD operations).
    - Handles the association between projects and users.

- **Document Storage & Management Module:**
    - Manages file uploads, downloads, and deletions.
    - Implements document versioning.
    - Organizes documents using folders and ordering.
    - Use local storage.

- **Information Retrieval & AI Module:**
    - **Document Processor:** A pipeline to parse different document formats, extract text content, and convert it into a searchable format.
    - **Search Index:** A robust search index (e.g., Elasticsearch, OpenSearch) for fast keyword-based document search.
    - **Chatbot Service:** Integrates with a Large Language Model (LLM) and uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to answer user queries based on the document content. The LLM integration is APIs from OpenAI or Gemini.
