/**
 * Interfaces Layer - Contains components that interact with external systems or users.
 * 
 * This package contains components that handle interactions with the outside world. It includes:
 * 
 * - REST Controllers: Handle HTTP requests and responses
 * - Request/Response Models: Data structures for API communication
 * - Validation: Input validation logic
 * - Exception Handling: Global exception handling for the API
 * - API Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI configuration
 * 
 * The interfaces layer depends on the application layer and converts external requests
 * into application layer calls, and application responses into appropriate external responses.
 * It handles the presentation of data to the outside world.
