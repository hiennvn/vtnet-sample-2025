# Product Context: Project Document Management System

## Why This Project Exists

### The Challenge
Organizations face significant challenges with project documentation:
- **Information Silos**: Documents scattered across email, shared drives, and personal storage
- **Version Control Issues**: Multiple versions with unclear lineage and outdated content
- **Access Difficulties**: Finding the right document at the right time is time-consuming
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Extracting specific information requires reading entire documents
- **Security Concerns**: Sensitive project information needs proper access controls

Traditional document management systems often fail to address these challenges holistically, leading to:
- Wasted time searching for information
- Decisions made with outdated or incomplete documentation
- Knowledge loss when team members leave projects
- Inefficient onboarding of new project members
- Limited ability to leverage existing project knowledge

### The Solution
The Project Document Management System provides a comprehensive solution:

**Centralized Repository**: A single source of truth where:
- All project documents are stored in one secure location
- Documents are organized in a logical folder structure
- Version history is maintained automatically
- Access is controlled based on project roles

**Intelligent Information Access**: Beyond simple storage:
- Powerful search capabilities across document content
- AI-powered chatbot to answer specific questions
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to synthesize information
- Reference tracking to verify information sources

**Streamlined Project Management**: Integrated project context:
- Project lifecycle management (active, on hold, completed, archived)
- Team member management with role-based permissions
- Clear visibility into project documentation status
- Efficient knowledge transfer between team members

### User Experience Goals
