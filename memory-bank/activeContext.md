# Active Context: Project Document Management System Development

## Current Work Focus
**Phase**: Backend Implementation - Authentication Endpoints
**Status**: Authentication endpoints implemented, moving to other backend components
**Date**: Current session

## Recent Changes
âœ… **Completed**:
- Created comprehensive technical architecture document (3.2.tech_structure.md)
- Developed detailed implementation checklist (3.3.implement_checklist.md)
- Created prototype HTML pages for the Project Document Management System
- Connected all prototype pages with proper navigation
- Designed UI based on Fluent 2 Design principles
- Set up Docker configuration for development and production environments
- Created initial database schema with MySQL
- Set up containerization for all services (backend, frontend, MySQL, Elasticsearch, Qdrant)
- Created documentation for Docker setup (docker-README.md)
- **Implemented authentication endpoints** for login, logout, and token refresh
- **Created JWT-based authentication system** with access and refresh tokens

## Current Task
**Backend Implementation**: Implementing core backend functionality starting with authentication endpoints

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Continue Backend Implementation**
   - Implement remaining API endpoints for user management
   - Develop project management endpoints
   - Implement document management functionality
   - Connect to database using the schema defined in V1__Initial_Schema.sql

2. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Initialize React TypeScript project
   - Create component structure following the prototype design
   - Implement authentication and authorization UI
   - Develop project and document management screens

3. **Document Processing Setup**
   - Configure document storage system
   - Set up text extraction pipeline
   - Implement document indexing with Elasticsearch
   - Create vector embeddings for semantic search

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Authentication Strategy
- **Decision**: Use JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens
- **Rationale**: Provides stateless authentication with good security and user experience
- **Implementation**: 
  - Access tokens expire after 30 minutes
  - Refresh tokens expire after 7 days
  - Token validation through JwtAuthenticationFilter
  - Secure password storage with BCrypt encoding

### Architecture Approach
- **Decision**: Use Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design
- **Rationale**: Ensures separation of concerns and maintainability
- **Impact**: More structured development process with clear boundaries between layers

### Storage Strategy
- **Decision**: Use local file system storage with metadata in MySQL
- **Rationale**: Aligns with requirements while keeping implementation straightforward
- **Implementation**: Storage path configured in Docker as volume mount at /app/uploads

### Container Strategy
- **Decision**: Use Docker Compose for development and production
- **Rationale**: Simplifies setup and ensures consistent environments
- **Implementation**: Created separate docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.prod.yml files

### Database Design
- **Decision**: Implemented comprehensive schema with users, projects, documents, and related entities
- **Rationale**: Supports all core functionality with proper relationships
- **Implementation**: Created in V1__Initial_Schema.sql with Flyway migration

## Context for Next Session
**If session resets, the next session should**:
1. Review the technical architecture document (3.2.tech_structure.md)
2. Check the implementation checklist (3.3.implement_checklist.md)
3. Continue implementation following the sequence outlined in the checklist
4. Focus on implementing remaining backend API endpoints
5. Use Docker Compose for local development environment

## Open Questions
1. Which specific LLM API (OpenAI vs. Gemini) should be used for the chatbot?
2. How should document chunks be sized for optimal RAG performance?
3. What level of test coverage should be targeted for the initial implementation?
4. Should we implement monitoring tools in the initial release or add them later?

## Dependencies
- Spring Boot 3.2.x with Java 17
- React 18.x with TypeScript
- MySQL 8.0 for relational data
- Elasticsearch for document indexing
- Qdrant as vector database for embeddings
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
- JWT for authentication (io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt)
