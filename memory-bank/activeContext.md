# Active Context: Project Document Management System Development

## Current Work Focus
**Phase**: Technical Architecture and Implementation Planning
**Status**: Architecture defined, implementation checklist created
**Date**: Current session

## Recent Changes
âœ… **Completed**:
- Created comprehensive technical architecture document (3.2.tech_structure.md)
- Developed detailed implementation checklist (3.3.implement_checklist.md)
- Created prototype HTML pages for the Project Document Management System
- Connected all prototype pages with proper navigation
- Designed UI based on Fluent 2 Design principles

## Current Task
**Finalizing Technical Documentation**: Architecture and implementation planning for the Project Document Management System

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Backend Implementation**
   - Set up Spring Boot project with Clean Architecture structure
   - Implement domain model entities and value objects
   - Create database schema with MySQL
   - Develop core services for user, project, and document management

2. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Initialize React TypeScript project
   - Create component structure following the prototype design
   - Implement authentication and authorization UI
   - Develop project and document management screens

3. **Document Processing Setup**
   - Configure document storage system
   - Set up text extraction pipeline
   - Implement document indexing with Elasticsearch
   - Create vector embeddings for semantic search

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Approach
- **Decision**: Use Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design
- **Rationale**: Ensures separation of concerns and maintainability
- **Impact**: More structured development process with clear boundaries between layers

### Storage Strategy
- **Decision**: Use local file system storage with metadata in MySQL
- **Rationale**: Aligns with requirements while keeping implementation straightforward
- **Next Step**: Implement StorageService with proper file organization

### Chatbot Implementation
- **Decision**: Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with OpenAI/Gemini API
- **Rationale**: Provides context-aware responses based on document content
- **Next Step**: Design prompt engineering system for effective RAG implementation

## Context for Next Session
**If session resets, the next session should**:
1. Review the technical architecture document (3.2.tech_structure.md)
2. Check the implementation checklist (3.3.implement_checklist.md)
3. Begin implementation following the sequence outlined in the checklist
4. Focus first on project setup and core domain model implementation

## Open Questions
1. Which specific LLM API (OpenAI vs. Gemini) should be used for the chatbot?
2. How should document chunks be sized for optimal RAG performance?
3. What level of test coverage should be targeted for the initial implementation?

## Dependencies
- Spring Boot 3.2.x with Java 17
- React 18.x with TypeScript
- MySQL 8.0 for relational data
- Elasticsearch for document indexing
- Vector database (Milvus or Pinecone) for embeddings
