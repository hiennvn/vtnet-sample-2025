# Active Context: Project Document Management System Development

## Current Work Focus
**Phase**: Backend Implementation - Core API Endpoints
**Status**: Authentication endpoints implemented, API controllers created for all major entities
**Date**: Updated on May 15, 2025

## Recent Changes
âœ… **Completed**:
- Created comprehensive technical architecture document (3.2.tech_structure.md)
- Developed detailed implementation checklist (3.3.implement_checklist.md)
- Created prototype HTML pages for the Project Document Management System
- Connected all prototype pages with proper navigation
- Designed UI based on Fluent 2 Design principles
- Set up Docker configuration for development and production environments
- Created initial database schema with MySQL
- Set up containerization for all services (backend, frontend, MySQL, Elasticsearch, Qdrant)
- Created documentation for Docker setup (docker-README.md)
- **Implemented authentication endpoints** for login, logout, and token refresh
- **Created JWT-based authentication system** with access and refresh tokens
- **Created API controller structure** for all major system entities:
  - Project management (ProjectController, ProjectMemberController)
  - Document management (DocumentController, FolderController)
  - User management (UserController, RoleController)
  - Chatbot functionality (ChatbotController)
  - Global exception handling (GlobalExceptionHandler)

## Current Task
**Backend Implementation**: Implementing core backend functionality starting with the API endpoints for all major entities

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Complete Backend Implementation**
   - Implement remaining service implementations for all controllers
   - Develop document processing and storage functionality
   - Connect document processing to search indexing
   - Implement vector embeddings for semantic search

2. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Create React components for all major UI sections
   - Implement state management with Redux
   - Connect frontend to backend API
   - Implement authentication flow and protected routes

3. **Testing Setup**
   - Set up Playwright for end-to-end testing
   - Create test cases for critical user flows
   - Implement unit tests for backend services
   - Implement component tests for frontend

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Authentication Strategy
- **Decision**: Use JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens
- **Rationale**: Provides stateless authentication with good security and user experience
- **Implementation**: 
  - Access tokens expire after 30 minutes
  - Refresh tokens expire after 7 days
  - Token validation through JwtAuthenticationFilter
  - Secure password storage with BCrypt encoding

### Architecture Approach
- **Decision**: Use Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design
- **Rationale**: Ensures separation of concerns and maintainability
- **Impact**: More structured development process with clear boundaries between layers

### Storage Strategy
- **Decision**: Use local file system storage with metadata in MySQL
- **Rationale**: Aligns with requirements while keeping implementation straightforward
- **Implementation**: Storage path configured in Docker as volume mount at /app/uploads

### Container Strategy
- **Decision**: Use Docker Compose for development and production
- **Rationale**: Simplifies setup and ensures consistent environments
- **Implementation**: Created separate docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.prod.yml files

### Database Design
- **Decision**: Implemented comprehensive schema with users, projects, documents, and related entities
- **Rationale**: Supports all core functionality with proper relationships
- **Implementation**: Created in V1__Initial_Schema.sql with Flyway migration

### Frontend Component Strategy
- **Decision**: Use Fluent 2 Design principles with custom components
- **Rationale**: Follows project requirements for consistent, modern UI
- **Implementation**: Created base components (Button, Toast, etc.) following Fluent 2 Design

### Testing Strategy
- **Decision**: Use Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
- **Rationale**: Ensures code quality and functionality from the start
- **Implementation**: Set up Playwright for E2E testing, JUnit for backend unit tests

## Context for Next Session
**If session resets, the next session should**:
1. Review the technical architecture document (3.2.tech_structure.md)
2. Check the implementation checklist (3.3.implement_checklist.md)
3. Continue implementation following the sequence outlined in the checklist
4. Focus on implementing remaining backend service implementations
5. Begin frontend implementation with React components
6. Use Docker Compose for local development environment

## Open Questions
1. Which specific LLM API (OpenAI vs. Gemini) should be used for the chatbot?
2. How should document chunks be sized for optimal RAG performance?
3. What level of test coverage should be targeted for the initial implementation?
4. Should we implement monitoring tools in the initial release or add them later?

## Dependencies
- Spring Boot 3.2.x with Java 17
- React 18.x with TypeScript
- MySQL 8.0 for relational data
- Elasticsearch for document indexing
- Qdrant as vector database for embeddings
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
- JWT for authentication (io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt)
- Playwright for end-to-end testing
