# Progress: Project Document Management System

## What's Working ‚úÖ

### Documentation and Planning
- **Requirements defined**: Product overview and user stories documented
- **Technical architecture created**: Clean Architecture with DDD approach
- **Implementation checklist developed**: Detailed tasks for all system components
- **UI prototype implemented**: Fluent 2 Design-based HTML prototype with navigation

### Prototype Components
- **Project listing page**: Displays all projects with filtering and navigation
- **Project details page**: Shows project information, documents, and folder structure
- **Document viewer**: Displays document content with metadata and version history
- **User management**: Interface for managing system users and roles
- **Project members**: Screen for managing project membership and permissions
- **Archived projects**: View for accessing and restoring archived projects

## What's Left to Build üìã

### Immediate Tasks (Next Sprint)
1. **Backend Foundation**
   - Set up Spring Boot project with Clean Architecture
   - Implement core domain entities and value objects
   - Create database schema with MySQL
   - Implement basic repository layer

2. **Frontend Foundation**
   - Initialize React TypeScript project
   - Create component structure based on prototype
   - Set up routing and state management
   - Implement authentication flow

### Medium-Term Tasks
1. **Core Functionality**
   - Project management features
   - Document storage and organization
   - User and permission management
   - Basic search functionality

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Document versioning
   - Document content extraction
   - Vector embeddings for semantic search
   - Chatbot integration with RAG

### Future Enhancements
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Caching strategies
   - Query optimization
   - Frontend performance improvements
   - Batch processing for document indexing

2. **Deployment and DevOps**
   - Docker containerization
   - CI/CD pipeline setup
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Production deployment

## Known Issues üêõ
- Need to determine specific LLM API (OpenAI vs. Gemini) for chatbot implementation
- Document chunking strategy for RAG needs to be defined
- Test coverage targets need to be established

## Metrics and Success Indicators

### Implementation Progress
- **Requirements & Planning**: 100% (complete)
- **UI Prototype**: 100% (complete)
- **Backend Implementation**: 0% (not started)
- **Frontend Implementation**: 0% (not started)
- **Document Processing & AI**: 0% (not started)
