# Progress: Project Document Management System

## What's Working ‚úÖ

### Documentation and Planning
- **Requirements defined**: Product overview and user stories documented
- **Technical architecture created**: Clean Architecture with DDD approach
- **Implementation checklist developed**: Detailed tasks for all system components
- **UI prototype implemented**: Fluent 2 Design-based HTML prototype with navigation

### Prototype Components
- **Project listing page**: Displays all projects with filtering and navigation
- **Project details page**: Shows project information, documents, and folder structure
- **Document viewer**: Displays document content with metadata and version history
- **User management**: Interface for managing system users and roles
- **Project members**: Screen for managing project membership and permissions
- **Archived projects**: View for accessing and restoring archived projects

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Docker configuration**: Complete setup for both development and production environments
- **Database schema**: Initial schema created with all required tables
- **Service containerization**: Backend, frontend, MySQL, Elasticsearch, and Qdrant services
- **Docker documentation**: Setup and usage instructions for development and production

### Backend Implementation
- **Authentication endpoints**: JWT-based authentication system with login, logout, and token refresh
- **Security configuration**: JWT filter, token provider, and password encoding

## What's Left to Build üìã

### Immediate Tasks (Next Sprint)
1. **Continue Backend Implementation**
   - Implement user management endpoints
   - Develop project management endpoints
   - Create document management functionality
   - Set up document storage and retrieval

2. **Frontend Foundation**
   - Initialize React TypeScript project
   - Create component structure based on prototype
   - Set up routing and state management
   - Implement authentication flow

### Medium-Term Tasks
1. **Core Functionality**
   - Project management features
   - Document storage and organization
   - User and permission management
   - Basic search functionality

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Document versioning
   - Document content extraction
   - Vector embeddings for semantic search
   - Chatbot integration with RAG

### Future Enhancements
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Caching strategies
   - Query optimization
   - Frontend performance improvements
   - Batch processing for document indexing

2. **Deployment and DevOps**
   - Kubernetes deployment
   - CI/CD pipeline setup
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Production deployment

## Known Issues üêõ
- Need to determine specific LLM API (OpenAI vs. Gemini) for chatbot implementation
- Document chunking strategy for RAG needs to be defined
- Test coverage targets need to be established
- Monitoring and alerting strategy to be determined

## Metrics and Success Indicators

### Implementation Progress
- **Requirements & Planning**: 100% (complete)
- **UI Prototype**: 100% (complete)
- **Infrastructure Setup**: 100% (complete)
- **Backend Implementation**: 15% (authentication endpoints completed)
- **Frontend Implementation**: 0% (not started)
- **Document Processing & AI**: 0% (not started)
- **Overall Project**: ~35% (foundation, infrastructure, and authentication complete)

### Quality Indicators
