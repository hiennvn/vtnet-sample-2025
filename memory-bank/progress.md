   - Implement API integration
   - Create protected routes and authentication flow

3. **Testing Implementation**
   - Create E2E tests for critical user flows
   - Implement unit tests for backend services
   - Create component tests for frontend

### Medium-Term Tasks
1. **Core Functionality**
   - Document storage and retrieval system
   - Document content extraction
   - Search functionality implementation
   - User and permission management

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Document versioning
   - Vector embeddings for semantic search
   - Chatbot integration with RAG
   - Advanced search capabilities

### Future Enhancements
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Caching strategies
