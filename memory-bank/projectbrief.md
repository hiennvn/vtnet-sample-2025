# Project Brief: Project Document Management System

## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive Project Document Management System that serves as a centralized platform for storing, managing, and retrieving project-related documents efficiently. The system enhances collaboration, ensures information accessibility, and streamlines project workflows for all stakeholders involved.

2. **Enhanced Accessibility and Collaboration**
   - Enable easy access to project documentation for all stakeholders
   - Implement role-based permissions for security and control
   - Support document versioning and change tracking

3. **Intelligent Information Retrieval**
   - Provide powerful search capabilities across document content
   - Implement an AI-powered chatbot for natural language queries
   - Enable users to find specific information without reading entire documents

4. **Streamlined Project Management**
